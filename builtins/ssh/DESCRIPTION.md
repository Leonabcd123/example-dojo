Finally, we will learn how to connect to the dojo via SSH! Start the challenge and use the workspace selector
on the bar below the Desktop to select "SSH". From there, follow the instructions for linking your SSH key (highlighted [here](/settings#ssh-key)).
After you've linked your SSH key, run:

`ssh -i path/to/private/key hacker@dojo.pwn.college`

This will connect you to this challenge! Once you've done all that, we'll give you the flag.
